Write a program that creates an array which can hold ten values. 
Fill the array with random numbers from `1 to 100`. 
Display the values in the array on the screen. 
Then use a *linear search* to find the largest value in the array, 
and display that value and its slot number.

<pre class="terminal">
Array: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50

The largest value is 93
It is in slot 4
</pre>
