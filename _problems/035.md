Using `if statements` with compound conditions (like `&&`), make a guessing game of two 
questions similar to the Twenty Questions assignment.

However, this time you must accomplish it using if statements with compound 
conditions and you **must not** use `else if` or `else` or nested ifs.

- Question 1: Does it belong inside or outside or both?
- Question 2: Is it alive?

Again, here are some sample responses, for the non-creative among you.

```
           inside            outside     both
alive      houseplant        bison       dog
not alive  shower curtain    billboard   cell phone
```

TWO MORE QUESTIONS, BABY!

Think of something and I'll try to guess it!

Question 1) Does it stay inside or outside or both? <kbd>outside</kbd>
Question 2) Is it a living thing? <kbd>yes</kbd>

Then what else could you be thinking of besides a python?!?

Obviously the nonliving, inside/outside thing on your mind is a dead ant!

## What to do on your own
You may notice that your program doesn't properly compare strings. To realiably compare strings
use the `.equals()` method. For example:
```java
String someString = "Hello";
if (someString.equals("Goodbye")) {
    // do whatever  
}

```
