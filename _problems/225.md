It is time we start to complicate the creation of classes.

Think about creating an instance of an object. And then assigning values to its fields.
```java
Student student = new Student();
student.firstName = "Frank";
student.lastName = "Smith";
student.birthYear = 1988;
```
Wouldn't it be nice to include all that on one line?

You *can*.

All you need is a **constructor** as part of your class to be able to take the specific 
data and automatically assign the data to the object's fields.

## Constructors
It is proper form to always include a constructor when creating a class. Essentially, 
a constructor is just a method that takes arguments and assigns them to the object's fields.

For our`Student` class, the constructor would look like this:
```java
class Student {
	.
	.
	.
	
	public Student(String firstName, String lastName, int birthYear) {
		this.firstName = firstName;
		this.lastName = lastName;
		this.birthYear = birthYear;
	}
	
	.
	.
	.
}
```

The `this` keyword comes in handy to differentiate between the parameter variable and the
*current* (`this`) objects field name.

Now, when we create an instance of a `Student`, we can assign the relevant info when it is created.

```java
Student student = new Student("Frank", "Smith", 1988);
```

*Just like any other method, it is important we know the order of the required parameters.*
