Modify your [dice](/problems/45/) game from last time so that it keeps rolling until they get doubles (the same number on both dice).

Notice that since there's no user input, this will happen very quickly (all the rolls will happen one right after the other).

<pre class="terminal">
HERE COMES THE DICE!

Roll #1: 3
Roll #2: 5
The total is 8!

Roll #1: 6
Roll #2: 1
The total is 7!

Roll #1: 2
Roll #2: 5
The total is 7!

Roll #1: 1
Roll #2: 1
The total is 2!
