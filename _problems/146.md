Create an array that can hold ten integers, 
and fill each slot with a different random value from `1-50`. 
Display those values on the screen, and then prompt the user for an integer. 
Search through the array, and if the item is present, say so. 
If the value is not in the array, display a single message saying so. 
Just like the previous assignment, if the value is present more than once, 
you may display the message as many times as necessary.

<pre class="terminal">
Array: 45 39 32 12 44 50 26 42 16 20
Value to find: <kbd>42</kbd>

42 is in the array.
</pre>
 
<pre class="terminal">
Array: 45 39 32 12 44 50 26 42 16 20
Value to find: <kbd>43</kbd>

43 is not in the array.
</pre>
