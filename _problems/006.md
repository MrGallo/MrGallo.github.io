<h2>Frequently-Asked Questions</h2>

**Does my letter have to look exactly like yours?**

No, but it does have to look roughly like a letter, including
the box around the outside and the stamp.

**Do I use my real address?**

**NO!!!**

**How to I get a `|` to show up on the screen?**

The `|` character is called a "pipe". Assuming you are using
a normal US keyboard, it is Shift + backslash (`\`). The backslash
key is usually located between the `Backspace` and `Enter` keys.

**Why doesn't my letter line up when I run the
program?!? Everything looks perfect in the code!**

You probably used a mixture of tabs and spaces between the
quotes in your `println()` statements. Many text editors / IDEs
will only move the cursor 4 spaces when you press `TAB`. But when your
program runs, any tabs embedded inside the quotes will take up 8 spaces, not 4.
If you delete ALL the tabs between the quotes and replace them with spaces, things
should look the same in your code and when you run the program.
