Modify your [incredibly stupid number-guessing game](/problems/40/) to actually pick a random number from 1 to 10 and have the user try to guess that. Tell them if they get it right or wrong, and if they get it wrong, show them what the random number was.

They will still only get one try.

<pre class="terminal">
I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 10.
Your guess: <kbd>3</kbd>

Sorry, but I was really thinking of 4.
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 10.
Your guess: <kbd>4</kbd>

Sorry, but I was really thinking of 7.
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 10.
Your guess: <kbd>2</kbd>

That's right!  My secret number was 2!
