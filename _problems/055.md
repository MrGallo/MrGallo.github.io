Write a program that gets several integers from the user. 
- Sum up all the integers they give you. 
- Stop looping when they enter a 0. 
- Display the total at the end.

You must use a `while` loop.

<pre class="terminal">
I will add up the numbers you give me.
Number: <kbd>6</kbd>
The total so far is 6
Number: <kbd>9</kbd>
The total so far is 15
Number: <kbd>-3</kbd>
The total so far is 12
Number: <kbd>2</kbd>
The total so far is 14
Number: <kbd>0</kbd>

The total is 14.
</pre>
 
<pre class="terminal">
I will add up the numbers you give me.
Number: <kbd>1</kbd>
The total so far is 1
Number: <kbd>2</kbd>
The total so far is 3
Number: <kbd>3</kbd>
The total so far is 6
Number: <kbd>4</kbd>
The total so far is 10
Number: <kbd>5</kbd>
The total so far is 15
Number: <kbd>0</kbd>

The total is 15
</pre>
