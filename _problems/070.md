Write a program that uses a `for` loop to display all the numbers from 1 to 20, 
marking those which are even (divisible by two). 
Use modulus 2 (`% 2`): 
`if` the remainder is zero, it's divisible by 2.

This means you'll need an `if` statement inside the loop.
```java
for ( <stuff> ) {
    if ( <something with modulus> ) {
        System.out.println( <something> );
    } else {
        System.out.println( <something different> );
    }
}
```
