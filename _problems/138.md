Create an array that can hold ten integers. Fill up each slot of the array with the number `-113`. Then display the contents of the array on the screen.

Do not use a loop. Also, do not use any variable for the index; you must use literal numbers to refer to each slot.

<pre class="terminal">
Slot 0 contains a -113
Slot 1 contains a -113
Slot 2 contains a -113
Slot 3 contains a -113
Slot 4 contains a -113
Slot 5 contains a -113
Slot 6 contains a -113
Slot 7 contains a -113
Slot 8 contains a -113
Slot 9 contains a -113
