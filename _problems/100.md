Write a function to compute the distance between two points. Given two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, the distance between these points is given by the formula:

![the distance formula](/problem-files/100/distance_formula.gif)

You must name the function `distance`, and it must return a `double` giving the distance between the two points.

Files Needed: [DistanceFormula.java](/problem-files/100/DistanceFormula.java)
 
```java
public class DistanceFormula {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // test the formula a bit
        double d1 = distance(-2,1 , 1,5);
        System.out.println(" (-2,1) to (1,5) => " + d1);
 
        double d2 = distance(-2,-3 , -4,4);
        System.out.println(" (-2,-3) to (-4,4) => " + d2);
 
        System.out.println(" (2,-3) to (-1,-2) => " + distance(2,-3,-1,-2));
        System.out.println(" (4,5) to (4,5) => " + distance(4,5,4,5));
    }
 
    public static double distance(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        // put your code up in here
    }
}
```
## What you should see
```
 (-2,1) to (1,5) => 5.0
 (-2,-3) to (-4,4) => 7.280109889280518
 (2,-3) to (-1,-2) => 3.1622776601683795
 (4,5) to (4,5) => 0.0
```
