Using if statements with compound conditions (like `&&`), make a program that displays a single message depending on the age given.
```
age            message
less than 16   "You can't drive."
16 to 17       "You can drive but not vote."
18 to 24       "You can vote but not rent a car."
25 or older    "You can do pretty much anything."
```

This output of this assignment is identical to the [How Old Are You, Specifically](/problems/25/) assignment. 
However, this time you **must** accomplish it using `if statements` with *compound conditions* and you **must not** use `else if` or `else`.

<pre class="terminal">
Your name: <kbd>Dukes</kbd>
Your age: <kbd>19</kbd>

You can vote but you can't rent a car, Dukes.
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
Your name: <kbd>Dukes</kbd>
Your age: <kbd>12</kbd>

You can't drive, Dukes.
</pre>
You can make up your own messages if you want, but you must have at least four messages, and you must use && statements to make sure only one of the messages is printed for any given age.
