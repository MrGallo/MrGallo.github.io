Make a program which plays a simple game of 20 2 Questions. The first question should be "animal, vegetable, or mineral?" Then, the second question should be "is it bigger than a breadbox?" Then, display one of six possible responses, depending on their answers. You can choose what answers to give for each of the six possibilities.

Here's a suggestion:

```
size \ type:              |    animal      vegetable       mineral
--------------------------|--------------|-------------|------------
smaller than a shoebox:   |    squirrel    carrot          paper clip
bigger than a shoebox:    |    moose       watermelon      Camaro
```

You will use **nested** `if` statements to do this.

<pre class="terminal">
TWO QUESTIONS!
Think of an object, and I'll try to guess it.

Question 1) Is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?
> <kbd>animal</kbd>

Question 2) Is it bigger than a breadbox?
> <kbd>no</kbd>

My guess is that you are thinking of a mouse.
I would ask you if I'm right, but I don't actually care.
