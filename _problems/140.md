Create an array that can hold ten integers. 
Fill up each slot of the array with a random number from 1 to 100. 
Then display the contents of the array on the screen. You *must* use a loop.

And, like last time, you *must* use the `.length` field of your array and not a literal number (like `10`) in the condition of the loop.

<pre class="terminal">
Slot 0 contains a 45
Slot 1 contains a 87
Slot 2 contains a 39
Slot 3 contains a 32
Slot 4 contains a 93
Slot 5 contains a 86
Slot 6 contains a 12
Slot 7 contains a 44
Slot 8 contains a 75
Slot 9 contains a 50
</pre>
