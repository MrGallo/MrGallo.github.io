Required files: 
- [Person.java](/problem-files/228/Person.java)
- [PersonTest.java](/problem-files/228/PersonTest.java)

Modify the included file by providing the class with a constructor method and 
proper encapsulation. I have added the JavaDoc for all required methods.

Checklist:
1. Constructor
2. Getters for `age` and `name`.
3. Setters for `age` and `name`.

Try to run the test file, first, by commenting out all the tests. 
Then, un-comment them one by one once you get them to pass.
