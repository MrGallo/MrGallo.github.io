This assignment is designed to give you practice compiling and
running a Java program.  Start by saving the following file to your
`pbd-solutions/02/` folder. Create the `02/` folder if you need to.

- <A HREF="https://github.com/MrGallo/MrGallo.github.io/blob/master/problem-files/02/SineWave.java">SineWave.java</A>


(You can save the file by right-clicking and choosing 
`Save Link As...`)

Compile the program with the `javac` utility and then
run the bytecode file using `java` interpreter, as shown below.

#### Linux
<pre>
~$ cd lastname
~/lastname$ cd pbd-solutions/02
~/lastname/pbd-solutions/02$ ls
SineWave.java
~/lastname/pbd-solutions/02$ javac SineWave.java
~/lastname/pbd-solutions/02$ ls
SineFrame.class     SineWave.class
SinePanel.class     SineWave.java
~/lastname/pbd-solutions/02$ java SineWave
</pre>

Done!
