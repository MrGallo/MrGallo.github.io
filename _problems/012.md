Write a program that stores your name and year of graduation into variables, and displays their values on the screen.

Make sure that:
- you use two variables
- the variable that holds your name is the best type for such a variable
- the variable that holds the year is the best type for that variable.

Also make sure that your variable names are *descriptive*: the name of a variable should always relate to its contents.

The template for your output will be:
```
My name is {name} and I'll graduate in {year}.
```
E.g.,
```
My name is Juan Valdez and I'll graduate in 2020.
```
In the correct code, the values `"Juan Valdez"` and `2020` will be stored in variables before printing.

You're doing it wrong if your source code looks like this:
```java
System.out.println( "My name is Juan Valdez and I'll graduate in 2020." );
```
