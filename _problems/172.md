Again, make a class to store information about a car. It should contain fields for:
- the make, which is a String
- the model, which is a String
- the year, which is an integer
- the license-plate number, which is a String

1. Create an array of type Car with five slots. (So far, this is the same as the previous assignment.)
2. Ask the user for the name of a file, and then open that file and read all the data from that file into the array.
3. Finally, display the values in the array.

<pre class="terminal">
From which file do you want to load this information? <kbd>cars.txt</kbd>
