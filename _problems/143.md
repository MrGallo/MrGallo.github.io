Prompt the user for a first and last name, and the name for a file. 
Randomly choose five grades for that person from `1 to 100` and store them in an array that can hold five integers. 
Then output the first and last name and those five grades to the specified file.

<pre class="terminal">
Name (first last): <kbd>Marc Antony</kbd>
Filename: <kbd>ettu.txt</kbd>

Here are your randomly-selected grades (hope you pass):
Grade 1: 54
Grade 2: 90
Grade 3: 18
Grade 4: 37
Grade 5: 62

Data saved in "ettu.txt".
</pre>

Later, if you look in `ettu.txt` (or whatever you called your file), you should see values like this:
```
Marc Antony
54 90 18 37 62
```
