Write a program that creates three variables: an `int`, a `double`, and a `String`.

Put the value `113` into the first variable, the value `2.71828` into the second, 
and the value `"Computer Science"` into the third. It does not matter what you call the variables... this time.

Then, display the values of these three variables on the screen, one per line.

``` 
This is room # 113 
e is close to 2.71828 
I am learning a bit about Computer Science 
```

Your program SHOULD NOT look like this:
```java
    System.out.println("This is room # 113");
    System.out.println("e is close to 2.71828");
    System.out.println("I am learning a bit about Computer Science");
```
You must use three variables. Your program will probably have nine lines of code inside the curly braces of the `main()` method.
