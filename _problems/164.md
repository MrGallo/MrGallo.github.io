Classes are nice, but they're even better when used with an array or arraylist.

The code provided does the same as the previous assignment, but, uses an Address array instead of one variable to store each object.

Files Needed: [WebAddressesArray.java](/problem-files/164/WebAddressesArray.java)

## What You Should See
<pre class="terminal">
1. 191 Marigold Lane, Miami, FL  33179
2. 3029 Losh Lane, Crafton, PA  15205
3. 4939 Holt Street, Lake Worth, FL  33463

## What You Should Do on Your Own
Assignments turned in without these things will receive half credit or less.

1. The code provided counts up to 5 in the loops instead of using the .length field of the array. Fix this.
2. Also, the code provided makes an array that only holds five addresses, but the text file contains six. 
Make the array bigger, so that all six addresses are read in.
