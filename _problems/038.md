Write a program that compares several Strings using the `.compareTo()` method. 
You should display the Strings and display the integer that `.compareTo()` gives you.

You must have five examples which result in a number less than 0, 
five examples which result in a number greater than 0, and two examples which give you exactly 0. 
This means you need a total of twelve examples.

You may not just flip the Strings around; you must have twelve different examples.

Here's an example:

```java
System.out.print("Comparing \"axe\" with \"dog\" produces ");
int i = "axe".compareTo("dog");
System.out.println(i);

System.out.print("Comparing \"applebee's\" with \"apple\" produces ");
System.out.println( "applebee's".compareTo("apple") );
```

<pre class="terminal">
Comparing "axe" with "dog" produces -3
Comparing "applebee's" with "apple" produces 5
</pre>
