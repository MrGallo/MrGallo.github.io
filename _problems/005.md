Comments are very important in your programs. They are used to tell
you what something does in English, and they also are used to disable
parts of your program if you need to remove them temporarily. Here's how
you use comments in Java:

```java
public class CommentsAndSlashes
{
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        // A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
        // Anything after the // is ignored by Java.

        System.out.println( "I could have code like this." ); // and the comment after is ignored.

        // You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
        // System.out.println("This won't run.");

        System.out.println( "This will run." );
    }
}
```

<p>From now on, I'm going to write code like this. It is important
for you to understand that everything does not have to be literal. Your
screen and program may visually look different, but what's important is
the text you type into the file you're writing in your text editor. In
fact, I could work with any text editor and the results would be the same.</p>

<h2>What You Should See</h2>

```
I could have code like this.
This will run.
```

<h2>What You Should Do on Your Own</h2>

<p>Assignments turned in <em>without</em> these things will not receive
any points. For this exercise, try these things.</p>


1. Were you right about what the two slashes (`//`) signify? Answer
in a comment at the top of the file (above the `public class` line).
2. Add another comment at the <em>very</em> top of the file (above your answer to the previous
question) with your name and today's date.
