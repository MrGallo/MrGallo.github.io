Using `if` statements, `else if`, and `else` statements, make a program which displays a different message depending on the age given.

```
age           message
less than 16  "You can't drive."
16 to 17      "You can drive but not vote."
18 to 24      "You can vote but not rent a car."
25 or older   "You can do pretty much anything."
```
Note that unlike the original [How Old Are You](/problems/22/) assignment, this program must only display exactly one message for a given age and not multiple messages.

<pre class="terminal">
Hey, what's your name? (Sorry, I keep forgetting.) <kbd>Billy_Corgan</kbd>
Ok, Billy_Corgan, how old are you? <kbd>17</kbd>

You can drive but you can't vote, Billy_Corgan.
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
Hey, what's your name? (Sorry, I keep forgetting.) <kbd>Billy_Corgan</kbd>
Ok, Billy_Corgan, how old are you? <kbd>14</kbd>

You can't drive, Billy_Corgan.
</pre>

You can make up your own messages if you want, but you must have at least four messages, and you must use `else if` statements to make sure only one of the messages is printed for any given age.
