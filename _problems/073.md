Get a blank sheet of paper (scratch paper is fine) and something to write with. 
Tell your teacher you'd like to take the *For Loop Challenge*. 
They will ask you to write an arbitrary `for` loop on the sheet of paper. 
If you do it without any mistakes, you will receive full points.

You may take this challenge more than once, but you'll receive 5 fewer points each time you do it. 
The for loop you must write will be different each time.

Here's an example of what you'll be asked to do:

```
"Write a for loop that makes the variable j go from 15 to 30, counting by 3s."
```
