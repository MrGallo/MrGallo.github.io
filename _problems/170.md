Using Notepad or the text editor of your choice, create a text file containing five names and five ages. 
Save this file in the same directory as your program.

Make a class to store information about a person. It should contain fields for:
- a single name, which is a String, and
- an age, which is an integer

1. Create an array of type Person with five slots. Call it `people` (since that makes sense).
2. Ask the user for the name of a file to open, and open that file and read in five names and ages from the file.
3. Display the contents of the array using a loop.

Reading data from nameage.txt
