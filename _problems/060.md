Write a program to take the square root of a number typed in by the user. Your program should use a loop to ensure that the number they typed in is positive. If the number is negative, you should print out some sort of warning and make them type it in again.

Note that it is possible to do this program with either a `while` loop or a `do-while` loop. 
(Though personally, I think this one is easier with a `while` loop.)

You can get the square root of a number `n` with `Math.sqrt(n)`. 
Make sure you don't do this until the loop is done and you know for sure you've got a positive number.

<pre class="terminal">
SQUARE ROOT!
Enter a number: <kbd>9</kbd>
The square root of 9 is 3.0.
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
SQUARE ROOT!
Enter a number: <kbd>2</kbd>
The square root of 2 is 1.4142135623730951.
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
SQUARE ROOT!
Enter a number: <kbd>-9</kbd>
You can't take the square root of a negative number, silly.
Try again: <kbd>-10</kbd>
You can't take the square root of a negative number, silly.
Try again: <kbd>10</kbd>
The square root of 10 is 3.1622776601683795.
