Create an array that can hold ten integers, and fill each slot with a different random value from `1-50`. 
Display those values on the screen, and then prompt the user for an integer. 
Search through the array, and if the item is present, give the index location of the item. 
If the value is not in the array, display a single message saying so. 
If the value is present more than once, you may either display the message as many times as necessary, 
or display a single message giving the last slot number in which it appeared.

<pre class="terminal">
Array: 45 39 32 12 44 50 42 26 16 20
Value to find: <kbd>42</kbd>

42 is in slot 6.
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
Array: 45 39 32 12 44 50 26 42 16 20
Value to find: <kbd>43</kbd>

43 is not in the array.
</pre> 

<pre class="terminal">
Array: 24 30 31 24 32 33 34 24 35 36
Value to find: <kbd>24</kbd>

    you may display either

24 is in slot 0.
24 is in slot 3.
24 is in slot 7.

    or

24 is in slot 7.
</pre>
