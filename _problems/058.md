Redo the [Dice Doubles](/problems/50/) assignment (the dice program with a loop) 
so that it uses a do-while loop instead of a while loop. 
Otherwise it should behave exactly the same.

If you do this correctly, there should be less code in this version.

<pre class="terminal">
HERE COME THE DICE!

Roll #1: 3
Roll #2: 5
The total is 8!

Roll #1: 6
Roll #2: 1
The total is 7!

Roll #1: 2
Roll #2: 5
The total is 7!

Roll #1: 1
Roll #2: 1
The total is 2!

## Frequently-Asked Questions
What is a do-while loop?
I don't have a good explanation written up. You'll have to [ask the Internet](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=do+while+loop+java). I'm sorry.
