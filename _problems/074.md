Write a program that gets an integer from the user. 
Add up all the numbers from `1` to that number, and display the total. Use a `for` loop to do it.

You have done something like this before.

<pre class="terminal">
Number: <kbd>5</kbd>

1 2 3 4 5
The sum is 15.
</pre>
 
<pre class="terminal">
Number: <kbd>8</kbd>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
The sum is 36.
</pre>
