<p>This assignment is designed to make sure that the Java compiler
(JDK) is correctly installed on your machine.</p>

Open a terminal window or command prompt. (In Windows `windows key + r -> cmd`)
Then type, in order, the commands below.

<pre>
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]
Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.

C:\&gt;<kbd>javac -version</kbd>
</pre>

<p>You will see one of two things. <em>If</em> the JDK / Java compiler
is correctly installed, you should see a version number like so:</p>

<pre>
C:\&gt;<kbd>javac -version</kbd>
javac 1.8.0_161
</pre>

<p>The exact version number doesn't matter, as long as it starts with "1.6" or higher.</p>

<p>However, if the JDK <em>isn't</em> installed, then you'll see an error like so:</p>

<pre>
C:\&gt;<kbd>javac -version</kbd>
'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</pre>

<p>If you're at home, I've got <a href="/problems/jdk-install/">instructions
for installing the JDK</a> that you can read. Once you install properly 
and add java to the PATH (on windows), close the command prompt and try 
this assignment again.</p>
