Make a class to store information about a car. It should contain fields for:
- the make, which is a string
- the model, which is a string
- the year, which is an integer
- the license-plate number, which is a string

1. Create an array of type `Car` with five slots. Have the user type in values to fill up the array.
2. Ask the user for the name of a file, and then open that file and output all the data from the array to that file.
3. Use Notepad or some other text editor to confirm that the data is correctly in the file. 
    - Be careful to only put data in the file, and not labels.
