Make a class to store information about a student, which should handle a name, a grade classification, and an average.

Create an array of type Student with three slots. Read in values for the three students and print them out again.

You must use a `for` loop.

<pre class="terminal">
Enter the first student's name: <kbd>Esteban</kbd>
Enter the first student's grade: <kbd>12</kbd>
Enter the first student's average: <kbd>79.3</kbd>

Enter the second student's name: <kbd>Dave</kbd>
Enter the second student's grade: <kbd>10</kbd>
Enter the second student's average: <kbd>91</kbd>

Enter the third student's name: <kbd>Michelle</kbd>
Enter the third student's grade: <kbd>11</kbd>
Enter the third student's average: <kbd>98.6</kbd>

The names are: Esteban Dave Michelle
The grades are: 12 10 11
The averages are: 79.3 91 98.6

The average for the three students is: 89.633333
