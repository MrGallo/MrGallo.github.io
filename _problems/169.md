Make a class to store information about a dog. It should contain fields for:
- a breed, which is a String,
- an age, which is an integer, and
- a weight, which is a double

Using Notepad or the text editor of your choice, create a text file containing the data above for two dogs.
**Save this file in same directory as this program.**

1. Create two Dog objects (not in an array).
2. Ask the user for the name of a file to open, and open that file and read in attributes.
3. Display the values you read in.

<pre class="terminal">
Which file to open: <kbd>dogs.txt</kbd>
Reading data from dogs.txt

First dog: Yorkie, 4, 14
Second dog: Great_Dane, 7, 93
</pre>
