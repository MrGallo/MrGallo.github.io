Write a program that picks a random number from 1-100. 
The user keeps guessing as long as their guess is wrong, and they've guessed less than 7 times. 
- If their guess is higher than the number, say "Too high." 
- If their guess is lower than the number, say "Too low." 
- When they get it right, the game stops. 
- if they hit seven guesses, the game stops even if they never got it right.

This means your while loop will have a compound condition using &&.

<pre class="terminal">
I'm thinking of a number between 1-100.  You have 7 guesses.
First guess: <kbd>50</kbd>
Sorry, you are too low.
Guess # 2: <kbd>75</kbd>
Sorry, you are too low.
Guess # 3: <kbd>87</kbd>
Sorry, that guess is too high.
Guess # 4: <kbd>82</kbd>
Sorry, you are too low.
Guess # 5: <kbd>84</kbd>
You guessed it!  What are the odds?!?
</pre>
