Create an array that can hold ten integers. Fill up each slot of the array with the number `-113`. 
Then display the contents of the array on the screen.

This time, you *must* use a loop, to put the values in the array and also to display them. 
Also, in the condition of your loop, you should not count up to a literal number. 
Instead you should use the `.length` field of your array.

<pre class="terminal">
Slot 0 contains a -113
Slot 1 contains a -113
Slot 2 contains a -113
Slot 3 contains a -113
Slot 4 contains a -113
Slot 5 contains a -113
Slot 6 contains a -113
Slot 7 contains a -113
Slot 8 contains a -113
Slot 9 contains a -113
</pre>
