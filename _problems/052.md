Type in the following code, and get it to compile.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PinLockout {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        int pin = 12345;
        int tries = 0;

        System.out.println("WELCOME TO THE BANK OF MITCHELL.");
        System.out.print("ENTER YOUR PIN: ");
        int entry = keyboard.nextInt();
        tries++;

        while (entry != pin && tries < 3) {
            System.out.println("\nINCORRECT PIN. TRY AGAIN.");
            System.out.print("ENTER YOUR PIN: ");
            entry = keyboard.nextInt();
            tries++;
        }

        if (entry == pin)
            System.out.println("\nPIN ACCEPTED. YOU NOW HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT.");
        else if (tries >= 3)
            System.out.println("\nYOU HAVE RUN OUT OF TRIES. ACCOUNT LOCKED.");
    }
}
```

## What You Should See

INCORRECT PIN. TRY AGAIN.
ENTER YOUR PIN: <kbd>23232</kbd>

INCORRECT PIN. TRY AGAIN.
ENTER YOUR PIN: <kbd>99999</kbd>

YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF TRIES. ACCOUNT LOCKED.

## What You Should Do on Your Own
Assignments turned in without these things will receive no credit.

1. Change the code so that it locks them out after 4 tries instead of 3. Make sure to change the message at the bottom, too.
2. Move the "maximum tries" value into a variable, and use that variable everywhere instead of just the number.
