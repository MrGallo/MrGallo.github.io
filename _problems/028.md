In this program, you'll use a loop to draw a simple ASCII-based animation on the screen, 
and you will use modulus (`%`) to determine which frame of the animation to show. 
(You will learn how to create your own loops later.)

Files Needed
- [ModulusAnimation.java](/problem-files/28/ModulusAnimation.java) - modify and turn in this one
- [ModulusAnimationWorm.java](/problem-files/28/ModulusAnimationWorm.java) - first example
- [ModulusAnimationSymbols.java](/problem-files/28/ModulusAnimationSymbols.java) - second example


## What You Should See
If you download, compile and run `ModulusAnimationWorm.java` it will look roughly like this.

```

```
(It will look cooler while it's running.)

## What You Should Do on Your Own
Assignments turned in without these things will receive no credit.

1. Add several if statements in `ModulusAnimation.java` so that it draws a little animation of your choosing. 
2. You must have a minimum of eight (8) different frames of animation, and it must loop smoothly.
