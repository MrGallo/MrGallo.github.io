It is time we start to complicate the creation of classes.

Think about creating an instance of an object. And then assigning values to its fields.
```java
Student student = new Student();
student.firstName = "Frank";
student.lastName = "Smith";
student.birthYear = 1988;
```
Required files: 
- [Dog.java](/problem-files/226/Dog.java)
- [DogRunner.java](/problem-files/226/DogRunner.java)

1. Create a constructor for the `Dog` class. Compile it.
2. Compile and Run `DogRunner` and ensure the output is as below.

## What you should see
```
Woof
Woof
Ralph is 28 dog-years old
Fido is 42 dog-years old
Fido is 14 dog-years older than Ralph
```
