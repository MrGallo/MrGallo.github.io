In this program, you'll see how to call functions. Functions are chunks of code with a name, and "calling" a function means to call on the function to do a task for you.

## What You Should Do on Your Own
Assignments turned in without these things will receive no credit.

1. Add the two missing function calls for menu options 3 and 4.
2. Change the code in the if statement for choice 1 so that it calls the 'butterfly' function twice instead of just once. What happens now when you run the program and choose option 1? (Answer in a comment right underneath where you added the extra function call.)
