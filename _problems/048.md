Type in the following code, and get it to compile. This assignment will help you learn how to make a loop, so that you can repeat a section of code over and over again!

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class EnterPIN {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        int pin = 12345;

        System.out.println("WELCOME TO THE BANK OF MITCHELL.");
        System.out.print("ENTER YOUR PIN: ");
        int entry = keyboard.nextInt();

        while (entry != pin) {
            System.out.println("\nINCORRECT PIN. TRY AGAIN.");
            System.out.print("ENTER YOUR PIN: ");
            entry = keyboard.nextInt();
        }

        System.out.println("\nPIN ACCEPTED. YOU NOW HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT.");
    }
}
```

<pre class="terminal">
What You Should See
WELCOME TO THE BANK OF MITCHELL.
ENTER YOUR PIN: <kbd>90210</kbd>

INCORRECT PIN. TRY AGAIN.
ENTER YOUR PIN: <kbd>11111</kbd>

INCORRECT PIN. TRY AGAIN.
ENTER YOUR PIN: <kbd>12345</kbd>

PIN ACCEPTED. YOU NOW HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT.
</pre>

Notice what happens when we type the correct PIN on the first try:

<pre class="terminal">
WELCOME TO THE BANK OF MITCHELL.
ENTER YOUR PIN: <kbd>12345</kbd>

PIN ACCEPTED. YOU NOW HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT.
</pre>

## What You Should Do on Your Own
Assignments turned in without these things will receive no credit.

1. How is a `while` loop similar to an `if` statement?
2. How is a `while` loop different from an `if` statement?
3. Inside the `while` loop, why isn't there an `int` in front of the line `entry = keyboard.nextInt()`?
4. Delete the line `entry = keyboard.nextInt();` from inside the `while` loop. What happens? Why?
5. (Put the `entry = keyboard.nextInt();` back before you turn in the assignment.)
