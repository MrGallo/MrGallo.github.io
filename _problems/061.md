Write a program to allow the user to enter three integers. 
You must use `do-while` or `while` loops to enforce that these integers are in ascending order, though duplicate numbers are allowed.

Tell the user whether or not these integers would represent the sides of a right triangle.

<pre class="terminal">
Enter three integers:
Side 1: <kbd>4</kbd>
Side 2: <kbd>3</kbd>
3 is smaller than 4.  Try again.
Side 2: <kbd>-9</kbd>
-9 is smaller than 4.  Try again.
Side 2: <kbd>5</kbd>
Side 3: <kbd>1</kbd>
1 is smaller than 5.  Try again.
Side 3: <kbd>5</kbd>

Your three sides are 4 5 5
NO!  These sides do not make a right triangle!
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
Enter three integers:
Side 1: <kbd>6</kbd>
Side 2: <kbd>8</kbd>
Side 3: <kbd>10</kbd>

Your three sides are 6 8 10
These sides *do* make a right triangle.  Yippy-skippy!
