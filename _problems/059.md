Redo the [Number-Guessing with a Counter](problems/53/) assignment using a `do-while` loop instead of a `while` loop. 
Otherwise it should do exactly the same things (including the counter).

Make sure that it doesn't mess up if you guess it on the first try.

<pre class="terminal">
I have chosen a number between 1 and 10.  Try to guess it.
Your guess: <kbd>5</kbd>
That is incorrect.  Guess again.
Your guess: <kbd>4</kbd>
That is incorrect.  Guess again.
Your guess: <kbd>8</kbd>
That is incorrect.  Guess again.
Your guess: <kbd>6</kbd>
That's right!  You're a good guesser.
It only took you 4 tries.
</pre>
