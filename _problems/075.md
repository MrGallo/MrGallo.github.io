Write a program that allows a human user to play a single hand of "blackjack" against a dealer.

1. Pick two values from 1-10 for the player. These are the player's "cards".
2. Pick two more values from 1-10 for the dealer.
3. Whoever has the highest total is the winner.
4. There is no betting, no busting, and no hitting. Save that for real blackjack.

<pre class="terminal">
Baby Blackjack!

You drew 6 and 5.
Your total is 11.

The dealer has 7 and 3.
Dealer's total is 10.

YOU WIN!
