This exercise will show you the detailed steps you must follow to create your first Java program.

Type in the code listed below in a text editor or an IDE.  Save your file as `FirstProg.java`.

```java
public class FirstProg {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Mr. Gallo is cool!");
    }
}
```
## In Linux
#### File Manager

Open the Terminal. You will start in your home directory `~`. 
```
(trusty)robuntu@localhost:~$ 
```
That space between the `:` and the `$` is your **current working directory**.
The current working directory is `~`, or "home".



#### Using Notepad (Windows)
<p>Launch Notepad.  (Start Menu | All Programs | Accessories | Notepad)</p>
<p>Keep Notepad open; you will need it again to correct potential errors.</p>

Open a command prompt. `(Windows key + R -> cmd)`.

Then type, in order, the commands below.</p>

```
Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]
(C) Copyright 1985-2001 Microsoft Corp.

C:\> cd My Documents
C:\My Documents> cd CompSci
C:\My Documents\CompSci> javac FirstProg.java
C:\My Documents\CompSci> 
```

<p>If the command appears to do nothing, then it's working correctly!
If it gives errors, though, then something is wrong.  Look back at your
code and fix any differences.</p>

<p>Once the compiling step (javac) completes with no errors, then your
new program is ready to run!</p>

<pre class=DOSBOX>U:\My Documents\CompSci&gt;<kbd>java FirstProg</kbd>
Mr. Mitchell is cool.

U:\My Documents\CompSci&gt;
</pre>

<p>You did it!  Now try changing the code so that the computer displays a 
different message.</p>
