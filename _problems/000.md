<p>First, you need the Java Development Kit (JDK) from Oracle. This is
the actual compiler that your development environment (IDE) uses behind
the scenes. Even if you already have Java installed, you probably still
need this. (Most people only have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
installed, which allows you to run existing Java programs but not compile
new ones.)</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>Direct your web browser to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/</a></p>

<p>Click the big "Java Download" button.</p>

<p>Once downloaded, run the executable. Follow the prompts to
install the JDK. You'll need administrator access.</p>

#### Important!!
<p>Next, you'll need to set an environment variable so that the command prompt can find the
java compiler. You can find instructions for <a href="http://programmingbydoing.com/a/jdk-path.html">editing the PATH</a> here.</p>

<p>Once you've added Java's <tt>bin</tt> folder to the PATH environment
variable, you can try the <a href="/problems/01/">Compiler
Check</a> assignment to make sure you've done it right.</p>

<h2>Mac OS X</h2>

<p>Good news! The JDK is usually installed by default on Macs, so just open up "Terminal"
and try the <a href="/problems/01/">Compiler Check</a>
assignment to make sure.</p>

<h2>Linux</h2>

<p>On Debian-based distros (such as Ubuntu), you should be able to open
up a terminal and install the JDK like so:</p>

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```

<p>Then, just try the <a href="/problems/01/">Compiler Check</a>
assignment to make sure everything worked.</p>

<h2>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h2>

<p>Although you can create Java programs in any text editor and compile/run them from the 
command-line, most students are more comfortable with an Integrated Development Environment 
that handles these things for them.</p>

I recommend you use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). You can get the Ultimate version by [applying for 
an education license](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/). Otherwise you can use the "community" version.
