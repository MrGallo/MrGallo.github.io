Write an interactive quiz. It should ask the user three multiple-choice or true/false questions about something. It must keep track of how many they get wrong, and print out a "score" at the end.

<pre class="terminal">
Are you ready for a quiz?  <kbd>N</kbd>
Okay, here it comes!

Q1) What is the capital of Alaska?
	1) Melbourne
	2) Anchorage
	3) Juneau

> <kbd>3</kbd>

That's right!

Q2) Can you store the value "cat" in a variable of type int?
	1) yes
	2) no

> <kbd>1</kbd>

Sorry, "cat" is a string. ints can only store numbers.

Q3) What is the result of 9+6/3?
	1) 5
	2) 11
	3) 15/3

> <kbd>2</kbd>

That's correct!


Overall, you got 2 out of 3 correct.
Thanks for playing!
