Write a program that simulates a random fortune from a fortune cookie. You must have at least six fortunes.

For bonus points, also add randomly-chosen lotto numbers to the fortune. In Texas, the lotto chooses 6 numbers, each from 1-54.

<pre class="terminal">
Fortune cookie says: "You will find happiness with a new love."
</pre>

Bonus output:

<pre class="terminal">
Fortune cookie says: "Stick with your wife."
