Modify your previous [number-guessing game](/problems/49/) so that they can guess 
until they get it right AND count the number of tries it takes them to guess it.

<pre class="terminal">
I have chosen a number between 1 and 10.  Try to guess it.
Your guess: <kbd>5</kbd>
That is incorrect.  Guess again.
Your guess: <kbd>4</kbd>
That is incorrect.  Guess again.
Your guess: <kbd>8</kbd>
That is incorrect.  Guess again.
Your guess: <kbd>6</kbd>
That's right!  You're a good guesser.
It only took you 4 tries.
