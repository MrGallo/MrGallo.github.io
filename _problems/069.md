Write another program that uses a `for` loop. 
With the loop, make the variable `x` go from `-10` to `10`, counting by `0.5`. (This means that `x` can't be an int.)

Inside the body of the loop, make another variable `y` become the current value of `x` squared. 
Then display the current values of both `x` and `y`.

To get your output to line up like mine, use a tab (`\t`).

-8.0    64.00
...
9.0     81.00
9.5     90.25
10.0    100.00
