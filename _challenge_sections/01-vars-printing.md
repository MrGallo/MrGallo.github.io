    You will be asked to declare two variables, assign specific values to them,
    and then print out the information with a relevant message. For example:
    ```
    Declare two integer variables 'x' and 'y'. Assign the value 14 to 'x' and
    assign the value 5 to 'y'. Print the statement "{x} is greater than {y}", except
    print out the values of the variables, not their name.
    ```
